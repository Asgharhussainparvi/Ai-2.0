Numerous studies support the role of dopamine in modulating aggression1,2, but the exact neural mechanisms remain elusiveHere we show that dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can bidirectionally modulate aggression in male mice in an experience-dependent mannerAlthough VTA dopaminergic cells strongly influence aggression in novice aggressors, they become ineffective in expert aggressorsFurthermore, eliminating dopamine synthesis in the VTA prevents the emergence of aggression in naive mice but leaves aggression intact in expert aggressorsVTA dopamine modulates aggression through the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a region known for aggression controlDopamine enables the flow of information from the hippocampus to the dLS by weakening local inhibition in novice aggressorsIn expert aggressors, dLS local inhibition naturally weakens, and the ability of dopamine to modulate dLS cells diminishesOverall, these results reveal a sophisticated role of dopamine in the rise of aggression in adult male miceNumerous studies support the role of dopamine in modulating
